# Visual-Presentation-Dashboard-of-Sales-in-Tableau
Create an interactive and visually informative Tableau dashboard for "The Bike Haven" to analyze sales data. It should include key metrics like total sales, profit, and orders, along with product performance insights such as top-selling items. Visualize revenue trends over time, map geographical sales distribution, and explore customer segments. Utilize bar charts, line charts, maps, and KPI cards to provide a clear and actionable overview. Include interactive filters for categories, regions, and time periods to enhance data exploration and support data-driven decision-making for improved business performance.
